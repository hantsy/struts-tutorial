===============

An aggregation o my blog entries written in several years ago about Apache Struts1.


## Introduction

The sample codes are based on my before blog entries from my old blog [http://hantsy.cublog.cn](http://hantsy.cublog.cn) which is discontinued. I moved to [http://hantsy.blogspot.com](http://hantsy.blogspot.com) now.

The content is about Apache Struts1. Yeah, it is TOOOOO old. I share these only hope it can help somebody who is using Apache Struts1.

## Sample codes

You can check out the sample codes from my Github.com.

<pre>
git clone https://github.com/hantsy/struts-tutorial.git
</pre>

In the root folder, it includes a ODT document which contains the detailed steps to create the sample codes.

[https://github.com/hantsy/struts-tutorial/blob/master/introduce-struts.odt](https://github.com/hantsy/struts-tutorial/blob/master/introduce-struts.odt)

The document is written in Chinese.

## Feedback

I have given up Apache Struts1 several years ago, so I will not maintain the sample codes and document. If you want to contribute this project, do not hesitate to contact me.
